              Has it ever occurred to you that eyesight does not necessarily
              have to deplete with time? Ever stop to wonder whether eye-related
              issues stem simply from aging? Based on the claims made by a
              retired medicinal chemist of 30 years,<strong> Larry</strong>, and
              brain expert,
              <strong> Dr. Kenji Kanamaro</strong>, many of the eye problems
              faced by consumers today are related to a particular enzyme
              buildup. This buildup acts as a deteriorator, forcing a halt in
              essential communications between the brain and eyes.
